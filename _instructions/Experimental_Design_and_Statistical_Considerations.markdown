##1. Experimental Design
###1.1. What

Experimental design encompasses features of a clinical trial that relate to its structure and operations.

###1.2. Why

Careful planning and documentation of design of a clinical intervention study is critical for maintenance of rigor and the obtaining of results that are likely to be reproducible. These considerations are intimately connected to the trial's appropriateness for formal statistical analysis and production of results. It is thus imperative that all aspects of design receive the highest level of scrutiny during the planning phase.

###1.3. How

The following items should be considered during the design phase.

1. Rationale for conduct of the trial
2. Rationale for the overall design
3. Overall goal
4. Specific aims
5. Outcome measures
6. Study Population
7. Indication or illness state
8. Safety Concerns
9. Ethical Considerations
10. Measurement and quantification of effects
11. Study Environment
12. Definition of efficacy and effectiveness
13. Nature of intervention
14. Administration of intervention
15. Study intervention period
16. Participant allocation to intervention or control
17. Statistical design and sample size
18. Schedule of interactions with participants
19. Trial leadership and investigative team
20. Staffing
21. Training

###1.4. Special considerations for older adults

Aging populations are subject to a number of factors that may induce bias or difficulty in analysis, including enhanced risk of attrition or competing risks, elevated prevalence of multimorbidity, difficulties with participant recall, and other factors^1^. These and related considerations must be carefully considered within the SAP and during analysis.

###1.5. Common pitfalls

Lack of specificity in describing measurement; lack of detail in considering manner by which participants may be contacted, recruited, and maintained in the trial.

##2. Statistical Analysis Plan
###2.1. What

The project Statistical Analysis Plan ( **SAP** ) provides **detailed** descriptions of statistical analyses to be conducted for the trial, including rationale for choice of methods, plans for dealing with unexpected difficulties, and pre-specified guidance on interpretation of results.

###2.2. Why

Guidance on data ascertainment, management, storage, analysis and interpretation are critical to preserve the validity of the design and soundness of scientific conclusions.

###2.3. How

A version of the SAP may be included as an addendum to or embedded within the study protocol and manual of procedures, but ideally the authoritative SAP should be an independent document with its own formatting, references etc. The SAP must be assembled prior to enrollment and approved by the appropriate parties including the trial statistician, investigative team, and regulatory authorities (e.g. DSMB), and may be included with the package submitted to Institutional Review Boards or equivalent overseeing ethical approval of the trial. Authorship should be by the project statistician, assisted by the investigative team. As with all trials documents, the SAP should be under strict version control, and a 'living' electronic date-stamped version considered the authoritative document (see **Essential Documents** ).

####2.3.1. Contents of the document

The contents of the SAP will vary from trial to trial. For a conventional intervention trial designed to assess efficacy, in which participants are allocated to one of two or more groups (e.g. intervention vs. control), contents might be as follows.

###2.4. Special considerations for older adults

Aging populations are subject to a number of factors that may induce bias or difficulty in analysis, including enhanced risk of attrition or competing risks, elevated prevalence of multimorbidity, difficulties with participant recall, and other factors [cite Van Ness et al]. These and related considerations must be carefully considered within the SAP and during analysis.

###2.5. Common pitfalls

Lack of specificity in describing techniques to be used and controlling decisions. Examples: failure to specify method by which standard errors are to be computed (model-based vs. robust. vs. resampling-based methods), failure to specify the set of covariates to be used in the definitive analysis (or method by which that set of covariates will be derived).

##3. Presentation of Pre-planned Statistical Analyses
###3.1. What

Presentation of statistical analyses to collaborators within the trial can range from casual exploratory communications to formal presentation of results as described in the SAP. In general, formal inference should follow the pre-specified plan laid out in the SAP, with particular attention to maintenance of blinding and the potential for introduction of bias, and investigators should consult regulations and guidance as to the degree to which discussion of preliminary analyses by the investigative team are appropriate. Formal presentation of results should follow an established template consistent with the SAP and include critical elements as outlined below.

###3.2. Why

Protection against confirmation bias and other hazards is critical for the maintenance of rigor and validity of conclusions. Following the agreed-upon template for analyses (as documented in the SAP) provides this protection.

###3.3. How

Analyses should be presented in memoranda constructed in a reproducible fashion, with carefully managed version control and documentation of data sources and other items as described below. Authorship should be a collaboration between the study statistician and other members of the analytic team, and must have as a contributor the persons actually performing the analysis.

####3.3.1. Contents of the document

1. I. Introduction and objectives. _Brief background for the proposed analysis, with particular attention to measurement or design issues relevant to the presentation of results._

    2. b. Software and computing environment. _Describes the analytic tools and machinery employed, including version numbers._
    3. c. Aims and Analysis Objectives. _Briefly states the aims and hypothesis of the analysis. Includes a brief prose summary how each aim was addressed in the analyses._

###3.4. Special considerations for older adults

See [Section 2.4](#2-4-special-considerations-for-older-adults).

##4. Planning, conduct and presentation of secondary analyses

Following or in parallel to completion of pre-planned analyses, secondary analyses may be requested or conducted. It is recommended that the trial employ a template for request and design of these analyses that mirrors the structure of the report described in [Section 3.3.1](#3-3-1-contents-of-the-document).
